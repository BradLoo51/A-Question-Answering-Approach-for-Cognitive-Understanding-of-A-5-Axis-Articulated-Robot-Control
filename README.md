# A-Question-Answering-Approach-for-Cognitive-Understanding-of-A-5-Axis-Articulated-Robot-Control

This is my undergraduate Final Year Project.

**Note that the movement control code in the repository is adjusted to my prototype due to several hardware limitations on the robotic arm such as the imprecise angle of the robotic arm frame due to the weight of the servo motor. Hence, the accuracy of the robotic arm in successfully locating its end effector to the desired coordinate varies, and some adjustments on the code would be needed to the movement control and working envelope.**

### Overview:
This project focuses on making a robotic arm to be a personal assistant. The concept is to develop a cognitive understanding for the robotic arm to understand the users intent through their commands, which can be an abstract or direct commands. From the commands, the robotic arm will execute the desired programmed actions to assist the user. It utilizes four different field of AI implementation: Artificial Neural Network, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. A prototype is build with the aforementioned implementation with some Robotic Engineering to showcase the use case of the project.

Materials used:
- Arduino UNO Maker
- Raspberry Pi 3B+
- 5 DoF Robotic Arm
- A Full HD Web Camera
- Sugus Candies (Blackcurrant, Orange, and Strawberry)
- 1oz (30ml) Paper Sampling Cups
- 6 180-Degree Servo Motors

Currently, the robotic arm is programmed to perform 3 tasks:
- Picking up a small cup
- Picking up a sugus candy
- Sorting the sugus candies
