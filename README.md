# A-Question-Answering-Approach-for-Cognitive-Understanding-of-A-5-Axis-Articulated-Robot-Control

This is my undergraduate Final Year Project.

**Note that the code in the repository is adjusted to a prototype due to several hardware limitations on the robotic arm such as the imprecise angle of the robotic arm frame due to the weight of the servo motor. Hence, the code is most likely unrepeatable and should only be used as a reference.**

### Overview:
This project focuses on making a robotic arm to be a personal assistant. The concept is to develop a cognitive understanding to allow the robotic arm to understand the users intent through their commands, which can be an abstract or direct commands. From the commands, the robotic arm will execute the desired programmed actions to assist the user. It utilizes three different field of AI implementation: Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. A prototype is build with the aforementioned implementation with some Robotic Engineering to showcase the use case of the project.

Currently, the robotic arm is programmed to perform 3 tasks:
- Picking up a small cup
- Picking up a sugus candy
- Sorting the sugus candy
